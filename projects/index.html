								<!-- During my bachelor, I discussed ideas for mobile applications with a couple of fellow students. 
                                Eventually, we realized that whenever we visited new cities, we had difficulties finding good venues
                                that suited our tastes. It is possible to search for clubs via Google search and get a list of bars, restaurants,
                                and clubs in the surrounding area. However, in some cases smaller venues are masked by the bigger ones or would not
                                show up at all in the search results. Furthermore, it is fairly difficult to search for places with a particular
                                theme (such as venues playing alternative music). Many of these clubs and bars are known to locals through 
                                word of mouth. Other apps that list local events in bigger cities exist. However, it is not possible to directly 
                                search for bars, clubs or restaurants on these apps. <br>
                                The idea of an app displaying local venues seems to cover a niche that has not been explored yet. Ideally, 
                                the app will keep entries of all relevant venues worlwide and offer a centralized solution for people that are 
                                looking for places in unfamiliar cities. To implement aforementioned idea, I created a project in Android Studio
								which I will be working on in the next weeks to months. The goal is to have a first draft of an app which can 
								display local venues with the use of Google maps and a list, showing the most importnat information. The repository 
								containing the project files can be found on my GitHub. More updates to follow.<br> -->

								<!-- Disclaimer</b>: extending the range of a WiFi network using a 802.1x access control standard should only be 
								done with consent of the network admin and for personal use. 802.1x requires a user to sign in to the network, hence 
								only the user should use the network.<br>
								One summer night when I was visiting my brother, him and I came across a challenge: At that 
                                time my brother was utilizing the campus network of his university which was transmitted from one of the neighboring 
								buildings. Unfortunately, the signal strength was low, which led to an inconsistent Internet connection. He was using 
								a USB WiFi amplifier to amplify the WiFi signal, providing a stronger signal for the device the amplifier was 
								connected to with the drawback of lower network speeds. 
                                <figure>
                                    <img src="../resources/TL-WN822N_EU_5.0_01_large_1507615225760s.jpg" title = "USB WiFi amplifier"/>
                                    <figcaption>Fig.1 - Example of a TP-Link USB WiFi amplifier.</figcaption>
                                </figure>
								Figure one depicts such a WiFi amplifier that my brother was using.
                                The problem was that the amplifier could only be used with one device at a time, meaning it did not act as an access 
								point for multiple devices.
								One might ask why we didn't use a router which can be used in range extender mode to receive the signal and create a 
								new private network. Unfortunately, the network access control standard for the WiFi network was 802.1x, a standard 
								often used in universities and public sector institutions in general. This standard involves a sign in with username 
								and password. The access standards used in regular WiFi routers do not comply with the 802.1x standard, which is why 
								the use of a common WiFi extender was not possible in that case. 
								Nevertheless, I was determined to find a way for extending WiFi signals using 802.1x access standards and quickly I 
								came across multiple websites describing possibilities of extending these types of networks using a Raspberry Pi and 
								some scripting. Right now I am looking into the capabilities of these tools and ways to implement them. More updates 
								will follow in the next weeks. -->
