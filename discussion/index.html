                                Since the global financial crisis of 2007/2008, many econometrists have warned about a repition of 
                                such events. In fact, global financial crises seem to occur roughly once every decade. Looking at 
                                the biggest global crises of the last 50 years reinforces the claim:

                                This is roughly one crisis every 9.4 years. If we look at the global annual GDP growth in % from

                                we can see strong negative correlation between above crises events and global GDP growth. The data is plotted 
                                in following figure:
                                </br></br>

                                The data is plotted with annual global GDP growth in percentage on the y-axis over the years 
                                1961 to 2023 on the x-axis. When inspecting the curve, we see local minima in the years 1975, 
                                1982, 1991, 2001, 2009, and 2020 with GDP growth of 0.56, 0.36, 1.21, 2.03, -1.34, and -2.88, respectively. 
                                An interesting observation from above plot is that seemingly, over time, financial crises become more volatile.

                                What does this mean for our current economy? And, maybe more importantly, could these observations be mere 
                                symptoms from deep-rooted dynamics in our financial system? 
                                In his book <a style="display: inline; color:blue" href="https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781101427422" title = "Crisis Economics" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">Crisis Economics</a>
                                Nouriel Roubini writes about causes of financial crises in the context of the current global financial system. 
                                In a nutshell (and please don't quote me on this), the instabilities that we regularly observe are rooted in 
                                the incentives that the capitalist financial and political system promotes. Especially when looking at the highly  
                                globalized economics in the Western Hemisphere, we see speculative and risky practices which are insufficiently 
                                mitigated by financial insitutions and governments alike. A recurrent theme throughout the decades has been the 
                                speculative bubbles in different financial sectors caused by risky investment practices. Roubini exemplifies 
                                some of these events with one of them being the Dot-com bubble. Enabled by rapid adoption of web technologies, 
                                at the end of the 1990s, an unprecedented number of tech companies found their way to the stock market. Enthusiastic 
                                investors poured assets into these newly established companies just to realize that most of them were not profitable 
                                nor mature yet. 
                                </br></br>
                                History tends to repeat itself. Could there currently be unsustainable investment practices? Like for instance 
                                in the EV (electric vehicle) sector in 2024? Tesla, for instance, has the highest

                                Many argue that especially Tesla's capitalization is largely inflated due to highly speculative investment 
                                practices. Perhaps much of Tesla's value comes from an overly optimistic valuation on the stock market. 
                                And what about AI? Every modern tech company and their mother is jumping on the AI hype train. Isn't this
                                an exact replica of the Dot-com bubble, just that this time it's not the broad theme of web technologies 
                                but the "AI solves all your problems" promise? 
                                </br></br> 
                                Getting back to the topic of financial practices and crises. From my own observation, our current economic
                                system enourages unsustainable ideologies. There seems to be a consensus, especially around finance cracks, 
                                that the only way forward is radical growth. However, in the current system, infinite growth is not possible, at
                                least not with unsustainable and highly speculative practices. These tend to lead to overvaluation, followed 
                                by disillusion, a decreased demand, and, finally, the burst. If we want to grow our wealth as a society, we have 
                                to grow our economy sustainably, driven by practicality and pragmatism. Not by hedonism. Investments need to be 
                                fair and propel quality of life for everyone. I'm getting too philosophical here. 
                                To conclude, I highly recommend reading Roubini's book about Crisis Economics. You will find many parallels, in the 
                                context of economic dymanics, between the past and present. And maybe you can profit from them yourself ;-]
