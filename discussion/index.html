                                Since the global financial crisis of 2007/2008, many econometrists have warned about a repition of 
                                such events. In fact, global financial crises seem to occur roughly once every decade. Looking at 
                                the biggest global crises of the last 50 years reinforces the claim:

                                This is roughly one crisis every 9.4 years. If we look at the global annual GDP growth in % from

                                we can see strong negative correlation between above crises events and global GDP growth. The data is plotted 
                                in following figure:
                                </br></br>

                                The data is plotted with annual global GDP growth in percentage on the y-axis over the years 
                                1961 to 2023 on the x-axis. When inspecting the curve, we see local minima in the years 1975, 
                                1982, 1991, 2001, 2009, and 2020 with GDP growth of 0.56, 0.36, 1.21, 2.03, -1.34, and -2.88, respectively. 
                                An interesting observation from above plot is that seemingly, over time, financial crises become more volatile.

                                What does this mean for our current economy? And, maybe more importantly, could these observations be mere 
                                symptoms from deep-rooted dynamics in our financial system? 
                                In his book <a style="display: inline; color:blue" href="https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781101427422" title = "Crisis Economics" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">Crisis Economics</a>
                                Nouriel Roubini writes about causes of financial crises in the context of the current global financial system. 
                                In a nutshell (and please don't quote me on this), the instabilities that we regularly observe are rooted in 
                                the incentives that the capitalist financial and political system promotes. Especially when looking at the highly  
                                globalized economics in the Western Hemisphere, we see speculative and risky practices which are insufficiently 
                                mitigated by financial insitutions and governments alike. A recurrent theme throughout the decades has been the 
                                speculative bubbles in different financial sectors caused by risky investment practices. Roubini exemplifies 
                                some of these events with one of them being the Dot-com bubble. Enabled by rapid adoption of web technologies, 
                                at the end of the 1990s, an unprecedented number of tech companies found their way to the stock market. Enthusiastic 
                                investors poured assets into these newly established companies just to realize that most of them were not profitable 
                                nor mature yet. 
                                </br></br>
                                History tends to repeat itself. Could there currently be unsustainable investment practices? Like for instance 
                                in the EV (electric vehicle) sector in 2024? Tesla, for instance, has the highest

                                Many argue that especially Tesla's capitalization is largely inflated due to highly speculative investment 
                                practices. Perhaps much of Tesla's value comes from an overly optimistic valuation on the stock market. 
                                And what about AI? Every modern tech company and their mother is jumping on the AI hype train. Isn't this
                                an exact replica of the Dot-com bubble, just that this time it's not the broad theme of web technologies 
                                but the "AI solves all your problems" promise? 
                                </br></br> 
                                Getting back to the topic of financial practices and crises. From my own observation, our current economic
                                system enourages unsustainable ideologies. There seems to be a consensus, especially around finance cracks, 
                                that the only way forward is radical growth. However, in the current system, infinite growth is not possible, at
                                least not with unsustainable and highly speculative practices. These tend to lead to overvaluation, followed 
                                by disillusion, a decreased demand, and, finally, the burst. If we want to grow our wealth as a society, we have 
                                to grow our economy sustainably, driven by practicality and pragmatism. Not by hedonism. Investments need to be 
                                fair and propel quality of life for everyone. I'm getting too philosophical here. 
                                To conclude, I highly recommend reading Roubini's book about Crisis Economics. You will find many parallels, in the

                                I asked myself this question back in 2018 when I started changing my diet from omnivore to vegan. But let's go back 
                                a little further. When I was in my early teens, my diet would mainly consist of bread, meat, milk, and sweets. It's 
                                a wonder I am still alive :-] </br>
                                Jokes aside, I heard pretty often that young people can get away with bad lifestyles. Some say it's because they are 
                                still growing. Maybe it also has to do with the short exposure to their lifestyle choices so they don't have such a 
                                big impact on their body. In any case, for the longest time I had been under the assumption that a meal without meat 
                                is not a proper meal. And that vegetables might be healthy but that you don't really need them that much. Well, as 
                                many things do, my diet starting changing once I moved out from home. I still took in animal products such as eggs 
                                and chicken. But, at least, the consumption of fatty and red meats, milk, and cheeses seemed to decrease. This was 
                                simply because your fridge only supplied those foods that you yourself provide. And in this case I didn't buy a 
                                whole spectrum of foods but rather selected a few that, I thought, would be the right ones for my lifestyle. That 
                                lifestyle, at that time, was predominantly revolved around sports. It still is today, but in a different way. More 
                                on that later. Things stayed like that for many of the following years. One thing that changed though, was my perception 
                                of what kinds of foods could be more beneficial for the development of my mind and body. Year after year, vegetables 
                                replaced many of the not so healthy foods. I started experimenting with protein shake as a way to replace the missing 
                                proteins from my now vegetable-centric diet. One more thing that I observed was that my breakfast was almost vegan. 
                                Since I moved out from home I've basically been eating the same breakfast: Oats in different variations. The first 
                                years mainly with fruits and yoghurt, nowadays with various nuts and with plan-based milk. I evolved my diet to be as 
                                efficient and nutritious as possible, as I've been steadily increasing my focus on sport, the healthy lifestyle, and 
                                a clear mind. Fast forward to 2019 and the only animal products I consumed were chicken and occasionally some milk. 
                                My roommate at that time introduced me to delicious vanilla soy milk which slowly replaced the remaining dairy products 
                                that I would occasionally still consume. So, there I was, with the only product that was non-vegan being chicken. So, 
                                I thought "What if I replaced chicken with a vegan alternative. Then my diet would be fully vegan. I could try it out, 
                                just for fun." And I did. I started using Tempeh instead of chicken, and, honestly, it wasn't too hard. Especially 
                                when preparing Tempeh properly. Obviously, I didn't fully restrict myself to animal products. So, from time to time, 
                                I would buy things like ham sandwiches. That was mostly on weekends as a treat. From the until now I consciously 
                                reduced even the little treats until I reached a point of full veganism. There might still be instances when I consume 
                                animal products, but that is because of politeness when eating self-made meals by others or to reduce food waste. 
                                Other than that, my diet is fully vegan! You can see that my transformation was quite natural and long. And for anyone 
                                who is contemplating something like this, I suggest to do it the same way. Everything takes time, especially changing 
                                something so deep-rooted as (eating) habits that also have some social construct embedded in them. 
                                </br></br>
                                Coming to the main topic. Over the years I read more and more about dieting and foods to incorporate or avoid in 
                                your diet. Part of my research also focused on the question if a vegan diet is detrimental to endurance and muscle 
                                strength. This is especially interesting for me as I do a lot of sport. A quick search on Google scholar yields some 
                                interesting research that could help us understand the impact of vegan diets on performance and overall health for 
                                physically active people.</br>
                                In their 
                                <a style="display: inline; color:blue" href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41430-020-0639-y" title = "Vegan Diet and Endurance/Strength" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">paper</a>, 
                                Boutros et al. examine endurance and muscle strength differences between vegan and omnivore participants. The authors 
                                "studied 56 healthy young lean physically active women [...] classified as vegan (n = 28) or omnivore (n = 28) based 
                                on their eating habits. All volunteers [who] followed either a vegan or an omnivore diet for at least 2 years." The 
                                results show that "vegans had a significantly higher estimated VO<sub>2</sub> max [...] and submaximal endurance time 
                                to exhaustion compared with omnivores." Further, "submaximal endurance might be better in vegans compared with omnivores." 
                                The authors suggest that "[o]ne potential mechanism that could explain the greater level of endurance performance in vegans 
                                may be a higher amount of carbohydrate intake. Evidence has suggested that greater carbohydrate intake may be associated
                                with a better endurance performance and this could be due to higher muscle glycogen storage." Also, "[o]ther potential 
                                mechanisms that may explain the better endurance performance in vegans could be due to favorable oxidative stress and 
                                inflammation profiles."</br> 
                                In their 
                                <a style="display: inline; color:blue" href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13113884" title = "Impact of Vegan Diet on Performance" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">explorative study</a>, 
                                Pohl et al. explain that "existing literature indicates the influence of particularly important nutrients [...] on 
                                molecular signaling in tissues and in the long-term different diet regimens may therefore affect exercise performance." 
                                Furthermore they suggest that "[v]egan and vegetarian diets possess potentially beneficial properties for the gut 
                                microbiome and might therefore influence those mechanisms which may affect in the long-term exercise performance."</br> 
                                Finally, Durkalec-Michalski et al. present an 
                                <a style="display: inline; color:blue" href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14040894" title = "Four-Week Vegan Diet on Performance" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">interventional study</a> 
                                "the effect of a four-week vegan diet [...] during a four-week high-intensity functional training [...] on performance, 
                                training results and blood biochemical indices" in a mixed group. The authors discuss that "[a]fter the four-week 
                                nutritional interventions, individual groups experienced a significant increase in the number of repetitions performed 
                                [...] and a significant improvement in the speed and a shorter time of completing training units [...]." Here, the authors 
                                mention that, at least for short and intense cross-training exercises, the increased intake of carbohydrates in vegan 
                                diets does not seem to have a positive effect on the performance of the test participants. The authors also mention that 
                                "endurance training tends to reduce iron stores" and that "a high prevalence of iron depletion and anaemia [in vegetarian 
                                diets] are based on the poor bioavailability of iron from plant sources." However, "iron deficiency anaemia rarely occurs 
                                in vegetarian athletes and a mild iron deficiency is not likely to impair performance. Surprisingly, contrary to what is 
                                commonly believed, this study did not reveal any significant changes in iron metabolism markers (iron, transferrin, 
                                ferritin) between the groups." The authors go on to talk about mixed observations in other studies regarding iron 
                                metabolism markers in people with vegan and omnivore diets.</br></br> 
                                From my personal observations, I can say that, in the six years that I am following a vegan diet, I couldn't observe any 
                                direct negative effects from this plant-based diet on endurance, muscle strength, and overall well-being. In fact, in these 
                                six years my strength and endurance have steadily increased albeit it probably having more to do with regular workouts 
                                rather than dramatic changes from the diet change. There have definitely been other observable positive effects, though. 
                                Since the change to plant-based products, I noticed that I very rarely get inflammations that I would usually get when 
                                following an omnivore diet. Those are, for instance, inflammation of my gums or my skin. Some studies 
                                [<a style="display: inline; color:blue" href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-78426-8" title = "Vegan diet and inflammatory markers 1" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">1</a>, 
                                <a style="display: inline; color:blue" href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-58875-x" title = "Vegan diet and inflammatory markers 2" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">2</a>, 
                                <a style="display: inline; color:blue" href="https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.118.011367" title = "Vegan diet and inflammatory markers 3" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">3</a>] 
                                suggest that there might be a link between a vegan diet and reduced inflammatory markers. Some studies explain, though, 
                                that the observations are not definitive and further studies are needed to support this claim. What is definitive is that 
                                some meats increase the quantitiy of inflammatory markers in humans, as shown 
                                <a style="display: inline; color:blue" href="https://doi.org/10.1093/cdn/nzac068.023" title = "Meats and inflammatory markers" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">here</a>. 
                                Especially red meats and poultry (and with that eggs) contain the omega-6 fat arachidonic acid which is shown to cause 
                                inflammation. This acid can't be found in vegetable sources. This could at the same time and potentially be disadvantageous 
                                for vegans as theses acids do have some benefits.</br> 
                                One other thing I definitely noticed is that I can process foods much quicker and easier now. I don't feel bloated, never 
                                have an upset stomach, and feel much lighter during my workouts with a strictly vegan diet. I can definitely feel the 
                                contrast on the rare occasion that I do consume some animal products, especially when they are greasy and overly spicy. 
                                Then, I get problems with my digestion and I feel sluggish. I also notice that a plant-based diet helps me get through the 
                                day easier without fatigue. This could be due to the omnivore diets often being heavier. I barely consume any added fats 
                                and keep my meals light and natural. The same can't always be said about omnivore meals that potentially contain processed 
                                foods. But then again, this might have more to do with preparing one's own meals or eating out. I noticed that I pretty 
                                much fully stopped eating out and preparing my own meals on a daily basis. Doing the same on an omnivore diet could yield 
                                the same benefits that I mentioned above.</br> 
                                One last thing that I would get off my chest is discussing some myths that go around in non-vegan communities. One thing 
                                I often hear from people that are open-minded and tried out a vegan diet before is something like "I tried the plant-based 
                                diet but after a couple of weeks I noticed a decline in mental and physical health. This surely has to do with something 
                                missing in plant-based diets that my body needs." Well, I would argue that it isn't the vegan diet in its broader sense 
                                that leads to such effects but rather the personal choice of a specific (vegan) diet. Becoming vegan by taking out all 
                                the animal products in your current diet without any substitutions and additional provisions is unsustainable. And I 
                                suspect that many people fail their transition because of that. Becoming vegan means informing oneself about macro- and 
                                micronutrients, one's own predespositions, and the importance of complete and well-balanced diets in general. And I 
                                recommend this to anyone, even outside of veganism. Many people around me know that I'm a big advocate of at least one 
                                protein-rich food source in each meal. This is something many people miss when not substituting animal products with 
                                plant-based products that are rich in proteins. Another thing is the link of vegan diets and vitamin B12 deficiency. 
                                It is true that vegans do need to supplements vitamin B12 in some form. From my own observations, there seems to be 
                                a consensus around non-vegans that a vegan diet is incomplete and can therefore not be healthy for a human, because of 
                                the need for certain additional supplements in vegans. However, what most people don't know is that these deficiencies 
                                are more of a symptom from a society that is, in a nutritional sense, based on a heavy meat industry which fails to 
                                address needs for people with other diets rather than stemming from veganism as a root cause. Vitamin B12, for instance, 
                                cannot be synthesized by either plants or animals. Instead, animals (and humans alike) get vitamin B12 through microorganisms 
                                which are ingested with soil or bacteria. The reason vegans don't get enough vitamin B12 through a plant-based diet is 
                                mostly because of plants being processed, that is, washed, peeled, etc., and the soil and bacteria being removed in the 
                                process. Omnivores don't need to care about this as the animal products they ingest are rich in vitamin B12 from the raw 
                                plants the animals consumed during their life. This is just one example of the skewed perception that currently exists 
                                for some when thinking about pant-based diets. There are many more interesting facts and I suggest reading about them if 
                                you are interested in the topic. Going further into detail about them here would go beyond the scope of this article.</br></br> 
                                Finally, I would like to say that just seven years ago I would have put people advocating vegan diets down as delusional. 
                                By informing myself about diets, tracking my health with regular blood samples, and gradually transitioning to a fully 
                                plant-based diet I established a sustainable way of veganism, <u>for myself</u>. There will definitely be nuances for 
                                other people with different physiologies. Or, a vegan diet might not be feasible at all for some people with certain 
                                predespositions or health issues. Nevertheless, and perhaps because of that, our health, it is imperative to learn about 
                                different diets, one's personal needs, and the possibilities of change.
