                Hello and welcome! I am happy to see you on my personal website.<br><br>
                My name is Bojan, I am currently studying Business Information Systems and I am fascinated by science, technology, and everything computer-related. 
                I have always been interested in technology and obsessed with computers. In my younger days I spent a lot of time with Messenger services and computer games. 
                As the years passed my interests shifted and I started experimenting with Windows scripts and system settings, until one day I had the idea of developing my own 
                website. As a stepping stone into the world of computer science, I turned to HTML and CSS scripting when I purchased this domain during my Bachelor study. 
                The website became a side project that I am working on since 2017. Since then I have increased my experience in computer science by learning new programming 
                languages and working on projects in different domains. The main purpose of this website is to introduce myself with my vita, experiences, and current projects 
                I am working on. Also, further down you can find some topics and papers regarding economics, business, and technology that I like discussing.<br><br>
                Have fun browsing and please feel free to leave a comment at the end of the website! Also, check out my GitHub repository and ResearchGate account, 
                which I have linked at the bottom.<br><br><br><br>

                            <td class="five">During my bachelor, I discussed ideas for mobile applications with a couple of fellow students. 
                                Eventually, we realized that whenever we visited new cities, we had difficulties finding good bars and clubs
                                that suited our tastes. It is possible to search for clubs via Google search and get a list of bars, restaurants,
                                and clubs in the surrounding. However, in some cases smaller venues are masked by the bigger ones or would not
                                show up at all in the search results. Furthermore, it is fairly difficult to search for places with a particular
                                theme (such as venues playing alternative music). Many of these clubs and bars are known to locals through 
                                word of mouth. Other apps exist, that list local events in bigger cities. However, it is not possible to directly 
                                search for bars, clubs or restaurants on these apps. <br>
                                The idea of an app displaying local nightclubs seems to cover a niche that has not been explored yet. Ideally, 
                                the app will keep entries of all relevant venues worlwide and offer a centralized solution for people that are 
                                looking for places in unfamiliar cities.<br>

                            <td class="five">One summer night when I was visiting my brother, my brother and I came across a challenge: At that 
                                time, my brother was using the network of his university for WiFi access. Unfortunately, he was far away from 
                                the closest access point, which led to an inconsistent Internet connection and a weak signal. He was using a USB 
                                WiFi amplifier which was designed in a way that it receives (weak) WiFi signals and amplifies them, providing  
                                a strong output signal to a device via the USB connection. 
                                <figure>
                                    <img src="http://dreamcloud.spfz1z7y5jpcwmep.myfritz.net/web_images/TL-WN822N_EU_5.0_01_large_1507615225760s.jpg" title = "USB WiFi amplifier"/>
                                    <figcaption>Fig.1 - Example of a TP-Link USB WiFi amplifier.</figcaption>
                                </figure>
                                The problem was that the amplifier had to be connected 
                                to his laptop at all times to ensure a good Internet connection. Also, the amplified signal was only available to
                                the device the amplifier was connected to, meaning it did not act as an access point for multiple devices. After 
                                discussing this issue with him, I was determined to help him and I was convinced that there are products online, 
                                offering a wireless extensions of a WiFi signal. Many people are familiar with WiFi repeaters, which receive a 
                                WiFi signal and "repeat" that signal for an increased signal range. These repeaters have one downfall: They 
                                require an Ethernet connection to the main access point, which sends the WiFi signal. And even when there were 
                                offers for wireless repeaters that did not require an ethernet connection to the main access point, they required 
                                a setup with the main network which is not possible if one does not have the access rights to that network. After 
                                some research, my brother and I found a solution to this problem which involves using a Raspberry Pi in combination 
                                with the aforementioned WiFi amplifier. Thankfully, there are quite a few tutorials online, discussing the setup 
                                of a Raspberry Pi for wireless WiFi extension.<br>

                                A while back I opened an account at an online stock broker (DeGiro). For the first year, I didn't really make any moves
                                but in early 2020 I decided to do some research on companies that could be worth investing in. At that time the global 
                                Covid pandemic started and, as many can recall, with the lockdowns the market took a severe beating. Like many others, 
                                I recognized the great potential of investing in companies that were shaken up by the pandemic and were undervalued. 
                                Fortunately, I opened the account with my stock broker the year prior which meant that I didn't have the trouble of waiting
                                for account verification, as many others had to. Due to the increased interest of people in investing, many brokers had 
                                issues verifying the increasing amount of newly opened accounts on their platforms.<br>
                                I fairly quickly deposited some money to my account and started buying stocks: For the beginning, I wanted to focus on 
                                medium to big German companies, as I am most familiar with the German market. After a quick search I found my first 
                                company: Lufthansa AG. Lufthansa is a German is the largest German airline and the second-largest airline in Europe 
                                in terms of passengers carried.
